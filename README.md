# 🌅 V4 Branch: Transitioning to Legacy 🌅

---

### ⚠️ **Important: Nearing End of Life (EOL)** ⚠️

This `release/v4` branch currently represents the **active maintenance line** for version 4.

**Development on the next major version (`v5`) has officially commenced!** 🚀

Once the **first official release of `v5` is published**, this `release/v4` branch will transition to an **End of Life (EOL)** state. At that point, `v5` will become the *only actively supported version* of this project, and `v4` will primarily remain for historical reference. There is no ETA for the `v5` release.

You are strongly encouraged to migrate to `v5` once it becomes available.

---

**For active `v5` development, please see the `release/v5` branch.**
**For the latest stable release, refer to the `main` branch (currently pointing to `v4`).**

# KamiCommon
**SEE [STRUCTURE.md](./STRUCTURE.md) FOR GRADLE MODULE BREAKDOWN**

- A common library originally intended for Spigot plugin development, expanded for standalone use too.
- The spigot portions of this library aim to support all versions (since 1.8.x) via its sister project [KamiCommonNMS](https://github.com/Jake-Moore/KamiCommonNMS)
  - View the NMS disclaimers here: [NMS Disclaimers](https://github.com/Jake-Moore/KamiCommonNMS?tab=readme-ov-file#disclaimers)

## Modules
There are 6 common modules, 5 of which can be safely shaded
- The 5 modules that can be shaded are:
  - `shared-utils`, `shared-jar`, `standalone-utils`, `standalone-jar`, `spigot-utils`
- The last module, `spigot-jar`, compiles the spigot plugin and is only intended to be used as an api
  - When using this module, remember to modify the `plugin.yml` to include `KamiCommon` in the `depend:` list
